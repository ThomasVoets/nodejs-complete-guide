## Useful Resources & Links

- [EJS Docs](http://ejs.co/#docs)

_Quick note:_ [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) & [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) are 2 other templating engines covered in the course. Both are not included in this repository (due to the fact that EJS is my favorite templating engine). Check out their official docs for more information.
