# Module Summary

## NodeJS and TypeScript

- TypeScript let us write better and less error prone code
- TypeScript offers build-in checks during compilation and during development => avoid errors at runtime
- Node itself is not able to execute TypeScript => Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- The only difference between Node with JS and with TS is the extra TypeScript syntax we can add
